## 📊 Projects Overview

### 1. 🚢 [Titanic Survival Prediction](./Titanic%20Project/)
**Binary Classification | Accuracy: 84.5%**

Predicted passenger survival on the Titanic using demographic and ticket information.

**Key Highlights:**
- Feature engineering: Extracted titles from names, created family size metrics
- Ensemble methods: Combined Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- Cross-validation: Achieved consistent performance across 5-fold CV
- Business insight: Identified that gender, age, and passenger class were strongest survival predictors

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 2. 🏦 [Bank Customer Churn Prediction](./Bank%20Customer%20Churn/)
**Binary Classification | ROC-AUC: 86%**

Built a model to identify customers likely to leave the bank, enabling targeted retention strategies.

**Key Highlights:**
- Business impact: Calculated ROI of 2,400% on retention campaigns
- Handled imbalanced data: Applied SMOTE for better minority class prediction
- Feature engineering: Created engagement scores and risk indicators
- Actionable insights: Identified high-risk segments (German customers, 3+ products)

**Tech Stack:** Python, XGBoost, Random Forest, SMOTE, Business Analytics

### 3. 🚜 [Bulldozer Price Prediction](./bulldozer%20price%20prediction/)
**Regression & Time Series | RMSLE: 0.229**

Predicted auction prices for heavy equipment using historical sales data and machine specifications.

**Key Highlights:**
- Time series features: Extracted temporal patterns from sale dates
- Large dataset: Handled 400,000+ rows efficiently
- Feature importance: Identified YearMade, ProductSize, and Enclosure as top predictors
- Model comparison: Random Forest outperformed linear models for non-linear relationships

**Tech Stack:** Python, Random Forest, Time Series Analysis, Feature Engineering
